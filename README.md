# FizzBuzz+

## Rules
The standard FizzBuzz game generates a list of numbers 1 through 100. Any numbers that are: 
1. Multiples of 3 are replaced with the word Fizz
2. Multiples of 5 are replaced with buzz  
3. Multiples of both are replaced with FizzBuzz

## Taken a step further
I decided to take this traditional coding project a step further with user input, making it more of a game! The computer takes the first turn, then you take every second turn. If you input the wrong answer then it's game over!
